An **automated system for smartly responding to Glassdoor reviews**, developed for **atolls**, using **n8n**, **React**, and **Next.js**.

<br/>

## Project Overview

This project automates the full process of **analyzing and responding to Glassdoor reviews**.  
The goal is to help companies:

- respond quickly to new reviews  
- create consistent and professional replies  
- reduce manual HR and employer branding work  

The system combines **workflow automation (n8n)** with a **modern web interface (Next.js / React)**.

<br/>

## System Idea

The system works fully automated:

1. A new Glassdoor review is detected  
2. The review is analyzed (sentiment, tone, content)  
3. A suitable response is generated  
4. The response can be approved automatically or manually  
5. The response is published or sent to the HR team
